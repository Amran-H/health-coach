It isn't necessary to fit each of these elements into every fitness session, but factoring them into your regular routine can help you promote fitness for life. A personal exercise programme is a strategy that details the physical exercises you should perform in order to reach your goals, and the amount of time you should spend on each exercise. Each programme is tailored specifically to the person's needs and goals."
